# Rage Calculator Version 2.03.C

## Ooh!!!

I hope everything is going well in this period.

But this Version is Insane...
## Introducing Version 2.03.C
I am calling this version as **Major Version**.
Well, you know I would be saying this for a reason.
So, let's find out...

## Features
- **Added Greeting at the Start of Calculator with Name**
-- The calculator asks your name and greets you.
-- This was one of the best thing that I made in this *2.03.C*

- **Added Greeting at the End of Calculation**
 -- This thing, you know. I already told it in the earlier points.

- **Now Calculator asks about itself**
 -- After each calculation,The calculator asks about what went good and what went poor.

- **The Calculator Never Ends after Giving the Result**
-- In my earlier versions the calculator would stop after giving the result.
-- But in this version, It will again start
-- One more thing that is a advantage is that the operators would be shown only one time, slashing down all the mess that is created.

- **Gives Result Invalid if you write different operator other than the listed**

                                üëç
 
## Functions used in the program 
 - **"print()"**(same)
 Ex. -> 
> print("Do we even need it ?")

- **"If...Elif...Else"**(old)
 Ex. ->
 >if c == "+"  :
 >
 >       print(a+b)
 >
 > elif c == "-" :
 >
 >     print(a-b)
 >     
 > else :
 >     print("Invalid Command")
 
- **"while True :"** (new)
-- Using this function runs the program forever.
-- Using this function only, I was able to re-run the program.

Well, This much only...

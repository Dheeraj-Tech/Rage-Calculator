# Rage Calculator Version 3.01.D

## Ooh!!!

I hope everything is going well in this period.

This Version is  special...
## Introducing Version 3.01.D

## Features
- **Added Comparison Operators**
-- Now you can compare numbers. 
-- This was one of the best thing that I made in this *2.03.C*
-- That's why our calcualator is better than others.

- **Introducing Dettio**
 -- Dettio- A virtual Assistant(but not smart,says recorded codes)

- **Gives Result Invalid if you write different operator other than the listed**

                                👍
 
## Functions used in the program 
 - **"print()"**(same)
 Ex. -> 
> print("Do we even need it ?")

- **"If...Elif...Else"**(old)(used nested also)
 Ex. ->
 >if c == "+"  :
        print(a+b)
 elif c == "-" :
      print(a-b)
 else :
      print("Invalid Command")
- **"while True :"** (old)
-- Using this function runs the program forever.
-- Using this function only, I was able to re-run the program.

Well, This much only...

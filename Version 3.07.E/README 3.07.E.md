## Introducing Version 3.07.E

- **Dettio-> Darweig**

 -- Dettio- A virtual Assistant(but not smart,says recorded codes) has changed to Darweig(Duh!!)
 
-**Shorter Outputs**

-- Calculator gives Short Outputs, Giving easier viewing to users

                                üëç
 
## Functions used in the program 
 - **"print()"**(same)
 Ex. -> 
> print("Do we even need it ?")

- **"If...Elif...Else"**(old)(used nested also)
 Ex. ->
 >if c == "+"  :
        print(a+b)
 elif c == "-" :
      print(a-b)
 else :
      print("Invalid Command")
- **"while True :"** (old)
-- Using this function runs the program forever.
-- Using this function only, I was able to re-run the program.

Well, This much only...

# Rage Calculator Version 1.02.B

So,I am Releasing the Second Version (1.02.B)

This Is not a major update but still...

>What's new in this version 
1>Added Loading Bar
2> Added 3 New Operations -> Modulus,Exponentiation and Floor Division

## Loading Bar
The code I have written for Loading Bar is this 

>from tqdm import tqdm 
>    
>for i in tqdm (range (1000), desc="Loading..."): 
>	pass

But the problem is for a begineer might not be familier. But no worries!!
I have written it to make The Result more amazing!!
